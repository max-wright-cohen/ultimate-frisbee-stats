This repository holds original data analysis for Ultimate Frisbee statistics.

Before Coronavirus, I spent a lot of my time playing and coaching Ultimate Frisbee in NYC. I picked up the sport in undergrad and I've loved playing it ever since! Ultimate is a 7v7 game that combines the running of soccer, jumping of basketball, and the throwing and catching of Football. The offense tries to score a point by throwing the disc between teammates, scoring by catching the disc in the endzone. It's played on a field roughly the same size as an American Football field, just a little narrower.

For the past few years (unfortunately not in 2020), I've played on an adult team called NYC Blueprint. We play competeitvely against other teams in our region and across the United States. During our 2019 season, we filmed some of our games and used that film to retroactively track our games using **statto**. Statto tracks thrower and receiver locations amongst other things.

Using the location data for each throw, I've been able to aggregate metrics like completion percentage, yardage gained, and probability of scoring across individual players, positions, and on-field roles. Notably, I've adapted **Expected Points Added** from Amercian Football to determine the value of throwers on average and in the aggregate. As far as I know, this is the first attempt to assess player value in Ultimate as a function of scoring probability.

I'm excited to show you and my team what I've learned from the data!
